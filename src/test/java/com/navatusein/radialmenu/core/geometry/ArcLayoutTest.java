/**
 * Placement of several inline rings on one level.
 *
 * <p>
 * The property worth pinning down is not where any one arc lands - that depends on its neighbours - but that no two
 * ever overlap and that none of them changes places with another. An overlap draws two menus over each other; a swap
 * draws a menu outside somebody else's entry, and both look like the mod lost track of the tree.
